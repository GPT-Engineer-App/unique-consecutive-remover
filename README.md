Remove identical letters
I need  a function that finds and removes instances of four identical consecutive lowercase letters. The function should delete as a few letters as possible.

Create a textbox and a button to execute the code

Assume that the maximum length of the string is 150 000 however please elaborate on changes you would do if the maximum length would be 20 million or higher?

Examples:

"ffdttttyy" should return "ffdtttyy"
"iiikigggg" should return "iiikiggg"
